### Findings
A structural system is the combination of structural elements and their materials. It is important for a structural engineer to be able to classify a structure by either its form or its function, by recognizing the various elements composing that structure. The structural elements guiding the systemic forces through the materials are not only such as a connecting rod, a truss, a beam, or a column, but also a cable, an arch, a cavity or channel, and even an angle, a surface structure, or a frame
Under the premise of the equivalent cad model, quantitative analysis of the impact of a PCB thickness to its natural frequency is made in ANSYS. The results show that the natural frequency of the PCB increases with the increase of the thickness, and the higher order leads to the faster growth, which will provide a reference for the PCB designing.
